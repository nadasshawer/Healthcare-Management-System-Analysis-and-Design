# Healthcare-Management-System-Analysis-and-Design

Skills: 📊 System Analysis · 🧩 Systems Design · 🗂️ UML Diagrams · 🧠 Project Management · 🤝 Team Leadership

For my System Analysis & Design university course, I led the design of CareCore, a Healthcare Management System, collaborating with a cross-functional team to streamline patient data workflows and improve healthcare service quality. I conducted feasibility and SWOT analyses, designed DFDs and process flows for optimized operations, and managed secure database implementation. The system enhanced data accessibility, security, and administrative efficiency, earning praise for its user-centric approach. Tools included UML, PERT charts, SQL, and collaboration platforms. This project honed my technical and teamwork skills while addressing real-world healthcare challenges.
